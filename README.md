# calculator
a screen calculator for simple math

so my calculator has:

+ Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division (of course).

+ Users are able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each  pair of numbers being evaluated at a time.

+ Answers with long decimals donâ€™t overflow the screen.

+ Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator doesn't cause problems!

+ Pressing "AC" (All Clear) wipes out any existing data.

+ Pressing "CE" (Clear Entry) wipes out only the last entry.

+ Displays a message if the user tries to divide by 0.

+ Users can use floating point numbers.

+ Keyboard can be used.
